# epagent-nozzle (1.0)


# Description
Creates a Nozzle for the [Cloud Foundry Firehose](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator) and reports metrics to the CA APM EPAgent REST interface. 

## APM version
This has been tested with APM 10.  An EPAgent 9.7.1 or greater is required for the REST interface.

## Supported third party versions
Tested with Cloud Foundry 215

## Limitations
Handles the [dropsonde-protocol events](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dropsonde-protocol/tree/master/events) except for Log.
By nature, the Firehose may generate a lot of metrics.  CA suggestes monitoring the load at the Enterprise Manager.
If the nozzle is unable to keep up with the Firehose, a message is posted to the log and the metric `Firehose|slowConsumerAlert` will be non-zero.  Try scaling up the resources for the nozzle.

# Installation Instructions
Follow the steps below in prerequisites, installation, configuration, and usage to get up and running with nginx metrics today!


* A user who has access to the Cloud Foundry Firehose configured in
your manifest

```
properties:
  uaa:
    clients:
      epagent-nozzle:
        access-token-validity: 1209600
        authorized-grant-types: authorization_code,client_credentials,refresh_token
        override: true
        secret: <password>
        scope: openid,oauth.approvals,doppler.firehose
        authorities: oauth.login,doppler.firehose
```

* A CA APM EPAgent 
* Golang installed and configured (see [here](https://golang.org/doc/install) for a tutorial on how to do this).
* godep (see [here](https://github.com/tools/godep) for installation instructions).

Once you've met all the prerequisites, you'll need to download the library and install the dependencies:

```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudcredo
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudcredo
git clone git@github.com:CloudCredo/graphite-nozzle.git
cd graphite-nozzle
godep restore
godep go build
```

Finally, run the app:

```
./graphite-nozzle --help
```







## Prerequisites
Ensure that nginx has the `--with-http_stub_status_module` flag by executing:

    nginx -V
The flag should appear in the output.

Using the value of the `--conf-path` flag in the output, identify your active [nginx config file](http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html#conf_structure).

A status URL location must be enabled under your server block.  An example is provided below:

    
      #add to existing server block
   
       location /nginx_status {
           # activate stub_status module
           stub_status on;
   
           # do not log status polling
           access_log off;
   
           # restrict access to local only
           allow 127.0.0.1;
           deny all;
      }
If you test the URL, the expected output should look similar to the following:

    Active connections: 1
    server accepts handled requests
    112 112 121
    Reading: 0 Writing: 1 Waiting: 0

A [RESTful CA APM EPAgent](https://wiki.ca.com/display/APMDEVOPS97/EPAgent+Overview) must be installed and the [HTTP port must be set](https://wiki.ca.com/display/APMDEVOPS97/Configure+the+EPAgent+RESTful+Interface).  The host and port running the EPAgent should be reachable from the epagent-monitor.

## Dependencies
APM EPAgent 9.7.1+

## Installation
Copy the **index.js** and **param.json** files to a convenient location.

From there, execute:

    npm install request

## Configuration
Edit the **config/caapm-firehose-nozzle.json** file to designate:

 - The status URL specified in the prerequisites 
 - The interval at which to poll that URL  
 - The host and port the CA APM EPAgent is using for HTTP

Here is a sample **param.json** file with nginx and the EPAgent both running on the localhost:

    {
    	"pollInterval" : 1000,
    	"url" : "http://127.0.0.1/nginx_status",
    	"epahost" : "127.0.0.1",
    	"epaport" : 9191
    }


# Usage Instructions
From the installation location, execute the fieldpack with:

    node index
Output will appear on the console, and hopefully the Introscope Investigator as well!

## Metric description
Reports the following metrics for requests:

    nginx|hostname:Average Requests per Connection 
    nginx|hostname:Requests per Interval

plus the following metrics for connections: 

    nginx|hostname|Connections:Active
    nginx|hostname|Connections:Idle
    nginx|hostname|Connections:Reading Request
    nginx|hostname|Connections:Writing Response
    nginx|hostname|Connections:Handled Connections
    nginx|hostname|Connections:Dropped Connections
    
    
## Metrics Overview

Following is a brief overview of the metrics that epagent-nozzle will extract from the Firehose and send off to CA APM.

### CounterEvent

CounterEvents represent the increment of a counter. epagent-nozzle will send these Long Counter metric. These metrics appear in the Investigator under `Firehose|ops|<counterName>`.

### ContainerMetric

CPU, RAM and disk usage metrics for app containers will be sent through to StatsD as a Gauge metric. Note that ContainerMetric Events will not appear on the Firehose by default (at the moment) so you'll need to run a separate app to generate these. There is a sample ContainerMetric-generating app included in the noaa repository [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/noaa/tree/master/container_metrics_sample). These metrics appear in the Graphite Web UI under `Graphite.stats.gauges.<statsdPrefix>.apps.<appID>.<containerMetric>.<instanceIndex>`.

### Heartbeat

Heartbeat Events indicate liveness of the emitter and provide counts of the number of Events processed by the emitter. These metrics get sent through to StatsD as Gauge metrics. graphite-nozzle also increments a Counter metric for each component whenever a Heartbeat Event is received. These metrics appear in the Graphite Web UI under `Graphite.stats.gauges.<statsdPrefix>.ops.<Origin>.heartbeats.*`.

### HTTPStartStop

HTTP requests passing through the Cloud Foundry routers get recorded as HTTPStartStop Events. graphite-nozzle takes these events and extracts useful information, such as the response time and status code. These metrics are then sent through to StatsD. The following table gives an overview of the HTTP metrics graphite-nozzle handles:

| Name | Description | StatsD Metric Type |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| HttpStartStopResponseTime | HTTP response times in milliseconds | Timer |
| HttpStartStopStatusCodeCount | A count of each HTTP status code | Counter |


For all HTTPStartStop Events, the hostname is extracted from the URI and used in the Metric name. `.` characters are also replaced with `_` characters. This means that, for example, HTTP requests to `http://api.mycf.com/v2/info` will be recorded under `http://api_mycf_com` in the Graphite web UI. This is to avoid polluting the UI with hundreds of endpoints.

Also note that 2 HTTPStartStop Events are generated per HTTP request to an application running in Cloud Foundry. graphite-nozzle will only increment the StatusCode counter for the HttpStartStop Events where `PeerType` == `PeerType_Client`. This is in order to accurately graph the incoming HTTP requests.

### ValueMetric

Any ValueMetric Event that appears on the Firehose will be sent through to StatsD as a Gauge metric. This includes metrics such as numCPUS, numGoRoutines, memoryStats, etc. These metrics appear in the Graphite web UI under `Graphite.stats.gauges.<statsdPrefix>.ops.<Origin>`.
